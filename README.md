# Non-life insurance mathematics

We consider the random variables X-Bin(10,1/2), N-Bin(60,1/2), M-Poi(30) and K-Geo(1/31). We define the portfolios S_N, S_M and S_K as:
S_N=X_1+...+X_N 
S_M=X_1+...+X_M
S_K=X_1+...+X_K

## Part 1 (Sections 2-5)

The main purpose of this part is to examine the distribution of portfolios given above. For that we're using the method involving the probability generating functions.

For the further investigation we're approximating the distribution by both Normal and Gamma distributions.

## Part 2 (Section 6-8)

In this part we discuss the <_{CX} ordering of the portfolios, some risk measures together with probability of ruin using the Cramer Inequality.

The main tool used in the project is Maple 2015. Paper was written using TeX.
